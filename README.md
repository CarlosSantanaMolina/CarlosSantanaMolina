Hello ðŸ‘‹ !, 

 I am Carlos Santana Molina, a computational biologist fascinated by the evolution of molecular systems like metabolic pathways and protein complexes. 

 Currently, I am  a postdoctoral researcher working on a collaborative project between NIOZ and the University of Utrecht together with Anja Spang and Berend Snel. Using computational approaches, we aim to deliver a detailed model on the origin of eukaryotes and trace the sources and subsequent diversification of eukaryotic enzymes relative to the most fundamental metabolisms like central carbon metabolisms
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m mainly woriking in molecular evolution fields using proteins sequence searches and phylogenetic approaches. In the background, I use to code my own scripts with shell and  python (and a little bit of R sometimes).
